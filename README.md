# Static Site Generator

This is a DIY static site generator meant to mimic the functionality of tools like Jekyll, Hugo, or Gatsby. It parses a directory of markdown files and generates HTML.
I built it to practice Python, Object-Oriented and Functional programming styles, and to make it easier for my wife and I to use our recipes. 
We have a lot of recipes that we like to cook but we hate scrolling through all the ads and popups on the sites where the recipes live. So I've been gradually adding our favorites as Markdown files in my Obsidian vault. 
Since my wife doesn't use Obsidian and I want her to have access to the recipes, I can now just run a script that will generate an up-to-date version of the site. I keep the site running on a Raspberry Pi on my local network so we always have access to it while we're cooking at home.
