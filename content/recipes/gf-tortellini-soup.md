## Instructions

1. Heat a large dutch oven or large pot with a lid over medium heat, then add your ground beef. Season well with salt and pepper. Cook until no longer pink, then remove from pot and set aside. 
2. Add 1-2 tbsp of olive oil to the pot, then stir in the garlic, onion, celery, and carrot. Season well with salt and pepper, pinch of red pepper flakes, and 1 tsp Italian seasoning. Allow to cook for 8 minutes, stirring occasionally.
3. Stir in your frozen chopped spinach, then add your crushed tomatoes, broth, and your cooked beef. Bring to a simmer, cover, and allow to simmer until veggies are soft, about 20-25 minutes.
4. Remove lid, then add your tortellini and cook according to package instructions (mine took 4 minutes). Turn off heat, add your fresh lemon juice, stir, taste and adjust seasonings as needed and serve. **Serving tip: be sure to add a few ladles full of just broth to the bowl in addition to the rest of the soup to keep it nice and soupy for dipping bread.**
