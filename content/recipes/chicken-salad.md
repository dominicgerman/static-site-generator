## Ingredients

- 2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts
- ½ cup sliced raw almonds
- 1 cup mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 cup red grapes quartered
- 2 celery ribs diced
- 3 green onions (green and white parts) sliced
- 2 tablespoon finely chopped parsley
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped tarragon
- 1 lemon juiced (about 3 tablespoons)
- kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

#### To Poach the Chicken

- Place the chicken breasts in a wide pot or pan and cover by about an inch with cold water. Season the water with salt. Optionally, you can add aromatics of your choice. Read my poached chicken recipe for more details.
    
- Turn the heat to medium until it reaches a gentle simmer. Then reduce the heat back to low and cover the pan. Let the chicken simmer for 8 to 12 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 160°F to 165°F. Remove the chicken and let it rest for a couple of minutes. Then chill in the fridge.
    

#### Chicken Salad Recipe

- Transfer the cooled chicken to a cutting board and dice it into ½-inch pieces.
    
- Slice and dice the celery, green onion, grapes, parsley and tarragon. Add those ingredients to a mixing bowl along with the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper.
    
- Mix everything together until it's well combined. Let it chill in the fridge until you're ready to serve.
