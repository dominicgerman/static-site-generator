https://food52.com/recipes/33605-white-bean-and-kale-soup-with-sausage

## Ingredients

- Olive oil
- 2 shallots, small diced  
- 2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped  
- 2 medium carrots, diced  
- 4 ounces cremini mushrooms, roughly chopped  
- 1/2 cup white wine  
- 3 cups vegetable stock  
- 1 15-ounce can white beans (like Great Northern), drained and rinsed  
- 2 tablespoons chopped rosemary  
- 1/4 bunch kale, stems removed and leaves torn or roughly chopped (should yield about 2 packed cups)  
- 1 pound sausage (like kielbasa or chorizo)  
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper  
- Crushed red pepper flakes  
- Parmesan cheese   

## Directions

1. Heat a few tablespoons of olive oil in a heavy bottomed pot over medium heat. Add the shallots and season with salt and pepper; cook down until almost transparent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, carrots, mushrooms, and a pinch of the red pepper flakes. Season and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened.
2. Add the wine and use it to loosen and scrape up all the awesome brown bits from the bottom of the pot. Cook until the liquid is reduced slightly.
3. Add the stock, beans, and rosemary. Bring to a boil, and then add the kale. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 15 to 20 minutes.
4. While the soup is cooking, brown the sausage in a medium pan. If crumbled, add directly to the soup. If linked, transfer to a cutting board. Thinly slice crosswise, stir into the soup.
5. Serve with a sprinkling Parmesan cheese. Plus bread — you're no fool.
