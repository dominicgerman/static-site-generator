- 1 large white onion, finely chopped, plus more, sliced, for serving
- Kosher salt
- 8 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 2 poblano chiles, seeds removed, finely chopped
- 2 Anaheim chiles or Cubanelle peppers or 1 poblano chile, seeds removed, finely chopped
- 1 jalapeño, seeds removed, finely chopped
- 1 tsp. ground cumin
- 1 tsp. ground oregano
- 1 tsp. mild red pepper flakes
- 1 tsp. paprika
- ½ head of escarole, trimmed, chopped
- 3 14-oz. cans cannellini (white kidney) beans, rinsed
- 4 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth or water
- 2 Tbsp. (or more) grated Parmesan
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1 small bunch spinach, trimmed, chopped
- Sour cream or yogurt and crumbled corn chips (for serving)

## Preparation

1. Heat oil and butter in a medium pot over medium-high until butter is melted. Add chopped onion and a large pinch of salt. Cook, stirring often, until softened, 6–8 minutes. Add garlic, poblano chiles, Anaheim chiles, and jalapeño and cook, stirring, until very tender, 8–10 minutes. Add cumin, oregano, red pepper flakes, and paprika. Cook, stirring constantly, until very fragrant, about 1 minute.
2. Add escarole and cook, stirring often, until wilted, about 3 minutes. Add beans, broth, and 2 cups water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to maintain a simmer. Stir in Parmesan, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors meld, 10–15 minutes. Taste and season with more salt and pepper and/or add more Parmesan if needed. Stir in spinach.
3. Ladle chili into bowls and top with dollops of sour cream, sliced onion, and corn chips.
